## A simple demo, stripping back web and ERP to its simplest form: a single list of entities to manage and display as a templated list.  

For this quickstart demo, we built an integrated website and backend system for a dog shelter client who needed to manage a list of dogs available for adoption as well as keep a record of those already adopted.  They wanted to display the information on a simple, clean website and allow browsers to view dogs by size.  Their staff needed to maintain the list of dogs available and easily record adoption details when a dogs left the shelter.
