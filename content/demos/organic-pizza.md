## A more complex demo featuring an AJAX-powered cart and content areas on the website, multiple lists and views and embedded lists in the admin panel with line actions  

Our second EcoSystem demo is slightly more complex and feature rich than the starter [Dog Shelter demo](/demos/organic-pizza/) and is typical of a simple e-commerce type application with custom ERP requirements.

The hypothetical client is an organic pizzeria looking for a clean website to showcase their organic pizzas and toppings.  

The client wants to display nutritional information for toppings and automatically calculate and display total nutritional information for pizzas.  For each pizza he wants to list toppings and link to those topping detail pages.  He'd also like to implement a simple cart and ordering system - he only needs to collect the customer's phone number as all orders are confirmed by phone, and no payment processing is required as payments are collected in cash on delivery.
 
In the admin panel he needs to be able to create new pizzas and toppings, and obviously add and remove toppings to and from pizzas.  He'd like prices of pizzas to be calculated automatically from the cost of the individual toppings and a fixed 300% markup.
