## Does this sound familiar to you?

- You run a small-medium-company that sells online online or,
- You have a great idea for a new venture needing significant online presence and integrated back-end systems,
- There is software that builds websites,
- There is even great software that builds commerce-enabled websites, like online stores, booking sites etc.,
- This software is expensive and complicated,
- There is other software that purports to run some aspects of your business,
- This software is expensive, complicated and long-winded to implement,
- This software doesn't like to do things the way you do things,
- If you are unlucky, there's nothing you can do about this,
- If you are lucky, there will be companies that can make this software do things the way you do things,
- This is expensive and complicated,
- Anyway, this software doesn't like talking to the aforementioned software that generates your website,
- If you are unlucky, there's nothing you can do about it.  You'll have to transfer the data manually.
- If you are lucky, there will be companies that will sell you yet more software that will make the abovementioned software talk to the aforementioned software,
- This is expensive, complicated and buggy,
- When you need more functionality, you'll go out and find yet another third-party piece of software,
- You'll then try to get it to talk to both abovementioned and aforementioned software,
- This is expensive and complicated,
- You eventually outgrow this spaghetti solution and go one of either two ways,
- You might decide to look at market leading enterprise ERP software that will do absolutely everything,
- This software is extremely complicated and extraordinarily expensive,
- And the module you need costs extra, a lot extra,
- And it doesn't quite do what you need,
- But luckily there is a company that will make it do what you need,
- Which is expensive and complicated,
- So you decide to develop a custom piece of software in-house to do exactly what you need,
- Which is just as expensive and just as complicated,
- After 6 months, your developer leaves, and no-one else understands what he's done,
- You go back to running your multi-million turnover company with a blogging platform, 8 plugins and a large spreadsheet.
