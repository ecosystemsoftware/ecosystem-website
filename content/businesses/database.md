title = "The role of the database in EcoSystem"

+++

## EcoSystem does not use or require you or your developer to learn a proprietary database system or programming language - it uses the open source and immensely powerful Postgres database which is programmed mostly with SQL - a mature and well known language.

Specifying the structure of your business at a database level affords almost unlimited flexibility in what EcoSystem can 'do', and ensures a high level of reliability, robustness and bug-free operation.

Virtually unlimited flexibility comes, of course, at a cost, which is the custom database programming that represents around 50% of the time-cost investment in an EcoSystem installation (with the remaining 50% in the [web templates](/businesses/server) and [administration interface](/businesses/admin-interface)).  However, as EcoSystem matures and developers encounter the same logical constructs across businesses, code can be reused, development times cut and costs reduced considerably where businesses share some of the same data structures and procedures.  After all, many businesses share similar characteristics (but no two business are the same).

So far we haven't actually discussed EcoSystem, per se.  Creating a custom relational database is a common first step in building a custom ERP solution in most technological stacks.  So what is EcoSystem and what does it actually do?
