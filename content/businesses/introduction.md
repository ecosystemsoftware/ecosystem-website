title = "Overview of EcoSystem for Business Stakeholders"

+++

## This is a semi-technical introduction to EcoSystem, aimed at owners of small businesses and technology decision makers in larger organisations.

  I say semi-technical because I do make specific references to technical concepts at some points, but only enough to explain, in broad terms, how EcoSystem is designed and what it does.  Don't worry if you don't understand absolutely all the technical concepts - this is meant to be a high-level introduction, so it's the overall philosophy that matters most.

If you're a developer, or a more technically inclined stakeholder, you can still gain a lot from this introduction, but you might want to progress to the [technical overview](/developers/introduction) in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of EcoSystem's architecture.
