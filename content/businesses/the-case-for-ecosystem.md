## The architecture of EcoSystem was conceived with a particular purpose in mind: to make life easier for businesses and ERP developers alike.

## EcoSystem is open source and always will be

- There is no charge to download, modify and use the base components.  There are no download, licensing, annual or per-user fees, irrespective of the size of your organisation.
- Your organisation is free to use all of EcoSystem, or only the parts that your installation requires.  
- As the creators and owners of EcoSystem, we (EcoSystem Software LLP) are committed to developing and maintaining the software for the long-term, at no cost to you.
- However, like all open-source projects, its existence and future development can continue in the unlikely event that we cease activity or change direction.  Your future success is not tied to ours - a key guarantee of open-source software.
- Like all open-source projects, EcoSystem also benefits from community contribution, accelerating development and testing, again, at no cost to you.

## Your EcoSystem installation is yours

- Since EcoSystem is not licensed or software-as-a-service, your installation is custom and private.  You don't share a server or database with anyone else (unless you want to) and are free to host on-premisis or in the cloud, with your provider of choice.
- You are free to work with whomever you choose for your EcoSystem installation.  If you have the experience, you can develop in-house (EcoSystem is easy to learn) or you can contract external developers or development teams, or choose companies specialising in EcoSystem development (like ourselves).
- Since EcoSystem is open, we cannot (even if we wanted to) place restrictions over who can and cannot offer technical services around EcoSystem - the market is completely open.

## The EcoSystem cost-model is different from outright-purchase or software-as-a-service models

- Again, you pay nothing to use EcoSystem in the form of licensing fees.
- The potential costs in an EcoSystem installation could be summarised as: general consulting and planning, general system design, custom database programming, website/application development, administration interface configuration, implementation and data transfer, servers and hosting, training, monitoring and maintenance.
- EcoSystem is deliberately designed to lower customisation and implementation costs and cut timescales by reducing complexity and embracing standards wherever possible.  There are no custom or proprietary programming languages or paradigms used and we try to keep arbitrary design decisions to a minimum - all with the aim of reducing barriers to entry for developers.
- We are strongly committed to making EcoSystem cost-effective to install and implement (although our aim is not to turn it into do-it-yourself, 1-click software).  We would like good ERP software to be affordable for organisations of all sizes.

## EcoSystem is modern and loosely-coupled

-  The three layers of EcoSystem (database, server and admin interface) are currently implemented in what we feel are cutting-edge technologies.  EcoSystem is fast and powerful.
-  More importantly, though, the layers that make up EcoSystem are loosely coupled, meaning that should any of them become obsolete, they can easily be recreated using new technologies without breaking the rest of the stack.  Large, monolithic ERP systems tend to turn into bloated, outdated code bases relatively quickly, making them harder and harder to maintain and causing companies that use them to lose their technical competitive advantage.  EcoSystem should be resistent to this.
-  Not only can layers be individually replaced should them become obsolete, but there is nothing to stop developers creating completely distinct alternatives at each level.  For example, should a developer feel that there is a better way to create the EcoSystem admin panel, he or she is free to create it and offer it as an alternative to the 'official' component.  In fact, an entirely possible future scenario is that multiple alternative components are available at each level of EcoSystem.
