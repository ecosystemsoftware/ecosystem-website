+++

## EcoSystem takes the custom route to ERP by assuming nothing about your business, which makes it powerful and flexible.

EcoSystem doesn't care whether you sell products, services or nothing at all; whether you deal with customers, suppliers, employees or no one at all; or whether you raise sales orders, purchase orders, tickets or invoices.

EcoSystem allows (in fact requires), you to specify the entities, items, services and transactions involved in your business, as well as the relationships between them and the logic that controls those relationships.  In an EcoSystem implementation, this is done right at the base of the technology 'stack' - in the database layer.
